# Security-Analysis-Projects
This repository features several virtual projects such as the creation of an attack and defense scenario using a Kali Linux machine, and a Windows 10 client. Additionally, items such as a logical diagram will be created for each individual project to showcase the topology. Lastly, each project will contain my thought process as I navigate towards completion of the project.
